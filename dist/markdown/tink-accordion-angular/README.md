## How to use

### tink-accordion

### Component

Wrap `tink-accordion` around at least one `tink-accordion-panel` to get the most basic version of an accordion.

```html
<tink-accordion data-start-open="true">
  <tink-accordion-panel data-heading="Basic accordion"></tink-accordion-panel>
</tink-accordion>
```

### Options

#### Accordion

Attr | Type | Default | Details
--- | --- | --- | ---
data-start-open | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the accordion panels are open on load or not. This can be overriden at the panel level.
data-one-at-a-time | `boolean` | `false` | Whether only one panel can be open at once.

#### Accordion panel

Attr | Type | Default | Details
--- | --- | --- | ---
data-is-collapsed | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the panel is collapsed or not.
data-heading | `string` | `''` | The title of the accordion panel.
data-onclick | `function` | `undefined` | Callback function that will be triggered when the accordion heading is clicked.
data-has-padding | `boolean` | `true` | Whether the panel has padding or not.

> Important! `data-is-collapsed` compares by reference, not value. Make sure it's part of an object that can be referenced.
