            <p>Adhesion is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another (cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles/surfaces to cling to one another).</p>

              <h2>Second level of stickiness</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types.</p>

              <h3>Third level of stickiness</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion.</p>
            <div data-tink-sticky data-tink-level="4">
              <h4>Fourth level of stickiness</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In addition to the cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are certain emergent mechanical effects that will also be discussed at the end of the article.</p>

              <h5>Fifth level of stickiness</h5>

            <p>Surface energy is conventionally defined as the work that is required to build a unit area of a particular surface.</p>

              <h6>Sixth level of stickiness</h6>
            </div>
            <p>Another way to view the surface energy is to relate it to the work required to cleave a bulk sample, creating two surfaces.</p>
